# Battleship Project

## Technology:
  
  - Python
  - Tkinter
  - Git

## Local Installation

battleships.py set up to run on the console.
extension.py imports code from battleship.py and creates a new window to play game using Tkinter. 

## Reflection

First large coding project. Would need to update coding syntax avoiding using:


```python

if statement == true:

```

Would also update Tkinter window so that you can click on the square to select target instead of typing row and columns in.
