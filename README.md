# Battleship Project

## Technology:
  
  - Python
  - Tkinter
  - Git

## Project Outline
Create a one player Battleship game, where the user has to sink all the ships in the fewest number of shots.

## Game information
- Ocean is a field of 10 x 10 squares
- The fleet consist of 10 ships made of 4 different types of ship
   - One battleship, occupying 4 squares
   - Two cruisers, each occupying 3 squares
   - Three destroyers, each occupying 2 squares
   - Four submarines, each occupying 1 square
 - No ships will be immediately adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

## Local Installation

Battleships.py set up to run on the console.

Extension.py imports code from battleship.py and creates a new window to play game using Tkinter. 

## Reflection

First large coding project. Would need to update coding syntax avoiding using:

```python

if statement == true:

```

Would also update Tkinter window so that you can click on the square to select target instead of typing row and columns in.
